# Android-Kotlin-Dependency-Injection-Playground

The Android Kotlin dependency injection playground project is a personal learning exercise with the goal of practicing various approaches to dependency injection on Android using Kotlin.


## Explore the samples

This project hosts the same sample application implemented using different dependency injectors for Android. Each framework is under a separate branch.

### Completed samples

| Sample | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Dagger 2](https://github.com/husaynhakeem/Android-Kotlin-Dependency-Injection-Playground/tree/dagger2) | Uses [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) to add support for [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).
Some Dagger 2 features used in this sample:
- Component
- Module
- Component dependencies
- Scopes
- Compoenent provision and injection methods |
| [Koin](https://github.com/husaynhakeem/Android-Kotlin-Dependency-Injection-Playground/tree/koin) | Uses [koin](https://github.com/Ekito/koin) to add support for dependency injection.
Some Koin features used in this sample:
- Module
- Context
- Bean
- Factory
- Dynamic parameters  |

### Samples in progress

| Sample | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Kodein](https://github.com/husaynhakeem/Android-Kotlin-Dependency-Injection-Playground/tree/kodein) | Uses [Kodein](https://github.com/SalomonBrys/Kodein) to add support for dependency injection. |


## The sample app

The chosen sample application is simple enough that one can understand it pretty fast, but intentionaly a bit more complex -than one would normally implement in a real world scenario- so as to implement as many features provided by the used dependency injection frameworks.
